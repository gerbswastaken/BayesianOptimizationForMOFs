# BayesianOptimizationForMOFs
A Github Repository of the codebase for using Bayesian Optimization and Particle Swarm Optimization for searching through a database of Hydrogen MOFs.

For the implementation of Bayesian Optimization, we followed the approach given in https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/ME/D1ME00093D.

Database: https://datahub.hymarc.org/dataset/computational-prediction-of-hydrogen-storage-capacities-in-mofs
Code for Particle Swarm and Evolutionary Particle Swarm is written from scratch.
