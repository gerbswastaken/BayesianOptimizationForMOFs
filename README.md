# BayesianOptimizationForMOFs
A Github Repository of the codebase for using Bayesian Optimization and Particle Swarm Optimization for searching through a database of Hydrogen MOFs.

A lot of the code from https://github.com/aryandeshwal/BO_of_COFs has been used; Namely implementation of Bayesian Optimization, Evolutionary Search, Random Search and some the visualizations

Database: https://datahub.hymarc.org/dataset/computational-prediction-of-hydrogen-storage-capacities-in-mofs
Code for Particle Swarm and Evolutionary Particle Swarm is written from scratch.
